Design features
msgq_client.c (Client)
→ !list ​- This command lists out all the active groups (groups with at least one member).
The groups are represented by a group id.
→ !join <group_id> -​ This command joins the client to the specified group number (may or
may not be present in the list). Client can join multiple groups.
→ !logout ​- This command logs out the client. The client can still interact with the console
(to login), but it stops receiving messages from groups.
→ !login ​- This command enables the client to login if logged out earlier. This command
must be used to login before sending any messages after logout. The client will receive
messages from all the groups it was part of (if any) when it was logged out.
→ @<group_id><space><message> ​- Format to send ​<message> t​ o the group having
group id as ​<group_id>​. Client cannot send messages to a group before joining it.
→ The client queue is in the format ​/<pid>q.
→ The parent process keeps reading from the client queue (opened with ​O_NONBLOCK
flag). The child process reads messages from user (STDIN) and sends them to the server. If
logged out, the parent process is sent to a waiting state due to a ​SIGUSR1 s​ ignal from the

2

child. When client logs in, child sends a ​SIGUSR2 s​ ignal to the parent to resume reading
from the client queue. Now parent dumps all the messages received while in logout state.
→ The messages received are of the format ​<message><space><pid> w
​ here ​<pid> i​ s the
process id of the client who sent the message to the group.
→ On exit (SIGTSTP, SIGQUIT, SIGINT), it closes and unlinks all message queues.

msgq_server.c (Server)
→ ​Server queue name - /​ sq
→ Keeps log of all the messages sent to the groups and broadcasts messages to the
intended groups (except the client who sent it).
→ Has a lookup table to maintain record of clients part of all the groups.
→ Maintains a list of active groups.
→ Appends pid of the client who sent the message to indicate who sent the message in the
group.
→ On exit (SIGTSTP, SIGQUIT, SIGINT), it closes and unlinks all message queues.
