II SEMESTER 2018-2019
LAB-1 EXERCISE
Course No.: IS F462
Deadline: 31st Jan

Course Title: Network Programming
Maximum Marks: 20M

Write a program signal.c taking N, K, L, and M as CLA for the following requirement.
(a) Parent process creates N processes and each of the N processes creates K child
processes.
(b) Each process selects a random number between 1 and 31 (except SIGKILL and
SIGSTOp) and sends that signal to one of the randomly selected process (among
N). Process should print signal number and the process id to the console.
(c) Each process follows step (b) M number of times. After that it checks if the
number of signals received is less than L, then it will terminate. Else it repeats
step(b) M number of times. When it terminates, it should print a message "Process
<pid> received x number of signals. So terminating.
(d) Before beginning the loop in (c), a process which has a child will check if all of its
children exited. If yes, it will also exit printing "Process <pid> exiting becuase all its
children exited".
Files Expected: A tar file <idno>_lab1.tar containing signal.c and makefile to compile
your program.
